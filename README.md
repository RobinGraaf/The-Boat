# WaveHalla

WaveHalla was created during the Global Game Jam of 2017, which had the theme 'Waves'. We chose to go for a game about penguin vikings, in which the player has to save his penguin friends *(for extra lives)*, collect some tasty fish *(for points)* and make sure to not hit the orcas who want to steal your fish *(don't die)*. As a diversifier we chose to make every sound in the game with our speech.

## What I've learned

* Working together with artists (pixel artist in this case)
* Working together with newly met people
* Designing a game which can be made within ~48 hours
* Narrowing the scope of an idea
